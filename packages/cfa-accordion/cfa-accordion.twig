  <p>An accordion element allows the user to expand and hide content on a page. Multiple accordions are usually used in tandem. It is useful to break up long pages for easy scannability.</p>

  <p><b>These documents are usually required to get CalFresh:</b></p>

  <ul class="list--bulleted">
    <li>A copy of your ID</li>
    <li>Proof of any income from the last 30 days</li>
    <li>Proof of student status (for college students)</li>
  </ul>

    <li>Copy of your green card (both sides)</li>
    <li>A copy of your most recent paperwork for a U Visa, T Visa, Asylum, Refugee or Parolee status, or VAWA petition</li>
    <li>Naturalized US Citizens may be asked to provide a copy of their US passport or naturalization papers</li>
    <li>Important: If you are only applying for other people in your household, you don’t have to provide proof of immigration status. </li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>These documents are optional but can increase your benefit amount:</b></p>

  <ul class="list--bulleted">
    <li>Proof of housing expenses</li>

    <li>Proof of child/dependent care paid</li>
